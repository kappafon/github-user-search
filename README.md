TODO:

-   Add pagination to user repos, and even users, cuz what am I sorting now? ðŸ˜… You guessed it; two ends and nothing in between
-   Cleanup the code (cleanup refactor, magic strings, magic colors...)
-   Back Button
-   Handle sorting refetch better
-   Add more useful info about specific user profile and repos, possibly implement 'settings' to preselect what info to fetch on search
-   Dark mode ofc
